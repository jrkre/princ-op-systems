# Principles of Operating Systems - UNR CS 446
## Administered by Professor Christos Papachristos

This holds the course content for CS 446, I have been working mostly in advance for this course, since all of the [assignments](https://www.roboticworkerslab.com/education/courses_1/principles-of-operating-systems) have been posted prior to taking the class.

Since I am an archive junkie, I've also included the assingment .pdfs, in case the professor for this course changes or the assignments change in the future. Sorry Christos.
